# Star Wars Media

## Description

Project made with Angular 9, ASP.NET Core and SQLite in purpose of creating a unique environment for Star Wars fans.

It consists of the marketplace page where various merch and cool things can be bought, films page where one can look through all episodes of the saga and watch trailers, and chat page for fanbase to chat over different topics.

The application uses REST approach and is REST-based (Web API). As ORM I for this project I used MS Entity Framework Core.
